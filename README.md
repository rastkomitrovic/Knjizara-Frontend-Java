# Knjizara-Frontend-Java
The "Frontend" part of my final exam project.
The project is a Java Spring web application which communicates with the REST application.
It uses the the Spring Secuirty in order to display diferent content on the JSP pages based on the user role.
Points for improvement here would be to use some JavaScript framework like React or Vue.js.
The next point to add here is the PayPal payment processor for credit cards,
finalize a few JSP pages and fix JSON parsing issue for Comment object.
